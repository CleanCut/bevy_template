# Bevy Template

An opinionated [Bevy] project template with a configuration script to run for the more complex parts (like setting up the fast-compile setup).

## Quick Start

- Click on [Use this template] and choose your new project name
- Clone your new repository to your development location (local laptop, etc.)
- Run `./setup` (macOS, Linux) to complete the setup

## Features:
- **Template-based.** - No Git history comes along for the ride. You can create private repositories directly from the template.
- **Git configured** - `.gitignore` is already set up for you.
- **Not license-restricted** - The included license is _for the template itself_.  Projects starting with this template may use any license (or no license at all).
- **Startup script** - Run the interactive setup script to configure the project beyond the template.  Configuration choices include:
  - Set the package name
  - Set the package author
  - Update to the latest version of Bevy
  - Set up the fast-compile config file
  - Install LLD (not working, yet - submit a PR!)
  - Install the nightly compiler
  - Configure the project to use the nightly compiler
  - Replace the README.md file
  - Delete the LICENSE file
